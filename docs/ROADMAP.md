## Phase 5 ‚Äî Swagger + dashboards + RBAC policies
- [x] OpenAPI served at `/api/openapi.yaml` and Swagger UI at `/api/docs`
- [x] OpenAPI lint in CI (Redocly)
- [x] Breaking-change gate (openapi-diff) in CI
- [x] RBAC deny audits emitted by middleware (one per denied request)
- [x] KPIs v1 (admin-only): RBAC denies rate (rolling window), Evidence freshness (threshold + by-MIME)
- [x] Auth brute-force guard (session/IP strategies) with `auth.login.failed|locked` audits
- [x] **OpenAPI serve headers hardened**: exact MIME, `ETag`, conservative caching, `nosniff`
- [ ] Fine-grained RBAC policies (PolicyMap/Evaluator) and role management UI hardening
- [ ] Predefined reports & dashboards (beyond KPIs v1)
- [ ] Admin/User docs baseline

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Additions (2025-09-23..2025-09-24)
- [x] **Runtime settings moved to DB** for all non-connection knobs; `core_settings` table + `SettingsServiceProvider` boot overlay.
- [x] **Admin Settings persistence path**: `apply=true` writes to DB; stub-only honored when configured.
- [x] **Metrics routes finalized**: `GET /api/dashboard/kpis` and alias `GET /api/metrics/dashboard`; controller clamps windows and returns `meta.window`.
- [x] **Web UI settings form** updated to DB-backed metrics fields; Vitest adjusted for PUT and stub/persist modes.
- [x] **Apache deploy verified**: `/api/*` routes to Laravel public with `AllowOverride All` and `mod_rewrite`; health and KPIs reachable.
- [ ] **KPI cache TTL** stored in DB (`core.metrics.cache_ttl_seconds`) and enforced in service layer.  
  - Child note: TTL key exists; enforcement to be implemented in MetricsService adapter.
- [ ] **Optional** `/api/openapi.json` mirror for integrators (tracked in Backlog).

---

## Phase 5.5 ‚Äî Theming & Layout
- [ ] Bootswatch theme set shipped; default **Slate**; light/dark toggle; respects system when no user choice.
- [ ] No-FOUC boot: early `<html data-theme data-mode>` script using cookie; SSR-safe.
- [ ] Design tokens & presets:
  - Color: full picker (wheel, hex, RGB, eyedropper). Persist RGBA.
  - Shadow: `none | default | light | heavy | custom(validated)`.
  - Spacing: `narrow | default | wide`.
  - Type scale: `small | medium | large`.
  - Motion: `full | limited | none`.
- [ ] Admin Theme Configurator with live preview, AA contrast guardrails, strict validation (422 on unsafe).
- [ ] Per-user theme and token overrides; admin ‚Äúforce global‚Äù still allows light/dark if available.
- [ ] RBAC: only `role_admin` or permission `admin.theme` can change global settings/import themes.
- [ ] Branding: primary/secondary/header/footer logos, favicon, title text; SVG sanitized; ‚â§ 5 MB each; defaults applied.
- [ ] Global layout:
  - Top navbar lists core modules; brand logo top-left acts as Home; sizing rules enforced.
  - Sidebar holds non-core modules; collapsible; user-resizable (min 50px, max 50% viewport).
  - Sidebar customization mode (long-press): Save/Cancel/Default/Exit; merge rules for new modules; per-user persistence.
  - User profile menu on right with profile/lock/logout entries (lock UX routed; full behavior Phase 6).
- [ ] Settings & APIs:
  - Global: `GET/PUT /settings/ui`, `POST/DELETE /settings/ui/brand-assets`.
  - Per-user: `GET/PUT /me/prefs/ui`.
  - Themes: `GET /settings/ui/themes`, `POST /settings/ui/themes/import`, `PUT/DELETE /settings/ui/themes/{slug}`.
- [ ] Theme pack import:
  - Accept `.zip` ‚â§ 50 MB; allow `.css .scss .woff2 .png .jpg .jpeg .webp .svg .map .js .html`.
  - JS/HTML stored but not executed in 5.5; scrubbed; manifest recorded; rate-limit 5/10min/admin.
  - Safe unzip (no traversal/symlinks; depth ‚â§10; files ‚â§2000; ratio guard).
  - Delete always permitted; users fall back to default; purge disk; audit.
- [ ] Tests: unit/feature for settings, prefs, RBAC, audits; Playwright snapshots for Slate/Flatly/Darkly; e2e for theme switch, override, sidebar flow.
- [ ] A11y: WCAG 2.2 AA, focus-visible, reduced motion honored; import shows ‚ÄúA11y warnings‚Äù if contrast risky.
- [ ] Notices: Bootstrap/Bootswatch licenses added to NOTICE.

---

## Phase 6 ‚Äî Integrations
- [ ] Integration Bus MVP (connectors, pipelines, transforms, observability)
- [ ] External Auth providers (OIDC/SAML/LDAP/Entra)
- [ ] Asset ingestion (CMDB, cloud, IPAM)
- [ ] Indicator framework
- [ ] BCP/DRP workflows, Vendor inventory, Incident logging
- [ ] Optional: sandboxed theme-pack JS/HTML enablement (separate origin/CSP)

---

## Phase 7 ‚Äî Release v1.0
- [ ] Prod deploy workflows
- [ ] Hardening & docs
- [ ] Release tag `v1.0.0`
