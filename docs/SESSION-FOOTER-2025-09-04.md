# Closeout
- Deliverables produced:
  - Phase 2 kickoff doc and spec.
  - API, middleware, model, config, migrations, routes stubs.
  - Web SPA auth route stubs and client wrappers.
- Phase/Step status: Phase 2 started â€” scaffolding ready for repo.
- Next action (you): Create these files in the repo with the content above and push a branch.
- Next action (me): Once files exist, I will refine TODOs and wire CI path filters if needed.
