## 2025-09-06 ‚Äî Phase 4: Audit persistence, hooks, and test-host bring-up

### Scope
- Enable DB-backed Audit trail with keyset pagination.
- Add centralized `AuditLogger`, scheduled retention purge, and controller hooks.
- Wire audit events for Settings updates and Auth stubs (login, logout, TOTP, break-glass guard).
- Stand up test host on :9000 with Apache + PHP-FPM and MySQL.
- Resolve deploy, env, and cache issues discovered during bring-up.

### Changes
- API
  - `app/Models/AuditEvent.php` ‚Äî promote stub to persisted model with casts.
  - `database/migrations/0000_00_00_000110_create_audit_events_table.php` ‚Äî enable table with indices.
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Audit/AuditController.php` ‚Äî DB-backed listing with cursor pagination; stub fallback.
  - `app/Services/Audit/AuditLogger.php` ‚Äî centralized write helper (ULID keys, UTC timestamps).
  - `app/Console/Commands/AuditRetentionPurge.php` ‚Äî purge events older than retention window, clamped [30..730] days.
  - `app/Console/Kernel.php` ‚Äî schedule `audit:purge` daily at 03:10 UTC.
  - `config/core.php` ‚Äî confirm `core.audit.retention_days` default 365.
  - `routes/api.php` ‚Äî audit route present; no change to path shape.
  - Settings: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SettingsController.php` ‚Äî validate and emit per-section `settings.update` audit rows.
  - Auth hooks:
    - `Auth\LoginController::login` ‚Äî emits `auth.login`.
    - `Auth\LogoutController::logout` ‚Äî emits `auth.logout`.
    - `Auth\TotpController::{enroll,verify}` ‚Äî emit `auth.totp.enroll` and `auth.totp.verify`.
    - `Middleware\BreakGlassGuard` ‚Äî constructor DI + emits `auth.break_glass.guard` 404 when disabled.
- Tests
  - `tests/Feature/AuditIndexTest.php` ‚Äî cursor pagination.
  - `tests/Feature/AuditRetentionTest.php` ‚Äî purge respects `--days`.
  - `tests/Feature/AuthAuditTest.php` ‚Äî login/logout/TOTP events + break-glass guard.
- Ops / Deploy
  - Built clean release tarball including `api/`.
  - Fixed `current` symlink to point at extracted release.
  - Provisioned Apache vhost on :9000 and PHP-FPM socket handler.
  - MySQL provision script (optional) and switch from SQLite.
  - Resolved `EnlightnServiceProvider` in prod by clearing caches / reinstalling prod deps.
  - Added `resources/views/.gitkeep` to avoid optimize warning (directory now exists).

### Evidence
- `curl` POST `/api/admin/settings` returned `audit_logged: 3`.
- `/api/audit` shows `settings.update`, `auth.login`, `auth.logout`, `auth.totp.enroll`, `auth.totp.verify`, `auth.break_glass.guard`.
- `php artisan test --filter=AuthAuditTest` passed on host after installing dev deps temporarily.

### Acceptance
- CI green after changes.  
- Audit rows persist; retention purge dry-run executes.  
- Break-glass returns 404 when disabled and emits audit row.

### Follow-ups
- Add crontab entry to run scheduler on test host.
- Evidence upload persistence and validation (Phase-4).
- RBAC enforcement pass (currently permissive middleware).
- Export job stub ‚Üí persisted job model + status polling.
