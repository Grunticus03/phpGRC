  - Evidence: `StoreEvidenceRequest` size/MIME guard; `EvidenceController` stores bytes with SHA-256, ETag, HEAD/304 behavior, cursor pagination; audit emits when table exists.
  - RBAC: `StoreRoleRequest` and endpoint tests; middleware pass-through verified.
  - Audit: index param validation hardened; stub fallback covered by tests.
  - Exports: spec and legacy POST endpoints tested; status and download stubs verified.
  - Break-glass: middleware guard tests for disabled 404 and enabled 202.

- Goal: Integrate RBAC middleware/gates and role bindings; keep Phase-4 behavior inert for anonymous; enforce for authenticated when enabled; resolve PHPStan generics.

  - Config: `core.exports` disk/dir defaults; capabilities map added.
  - CI and static analysis green.
- Phase/Step status: Phase 4 ‚Äî CORE-008 Exports E2E complete; exports RBAC enforced; phase continues with remaining RBAC fine-grained items and docs sync.

### Session 2025-09-12: Phase 4 ‚Äî RBAC Audit Canonicalization + Filters + Retention
- Context: RBAC role-change audit needed canonical names; audit list required filters; retention job needed scheduling.
- Goal: Emit `rbac.role.created` and `rbac.user_role.{attached,detached,replaced}` with legacy alias events; ship list filters; add `audit:purge` and daily scheduler.
- Constraints: Keep CI and static analysis green; full-file outputs only.

# Closeout
- Deliverables produced:
  - Controllers updated to emit canonical RBAC actions and legacy `role.*` aliases.
  - `AuditController@index` reads filters: category, action, occurred_from/to, actor_id, entity_type/id, ip; echoes `filters` and `_retention_days`.
  - Command `audit:purge` with `--days` and `--dry-run`; returns `AUDIT_RETENTION_INVALID` on out-of-range; transactional delete.
  - Scheduler: runs `audit:purge` daily at 03:10 UTC; clamps days to [30,730].
  - Docs updated: `PHASE-4-SPEC.md` (audit filters, RBAC actions, retention), `PHASE-4-TASK-BREAKDOWN.md`, `CAPABILITIES.md`.
  - Tests: `RbacAuditTest` green; CI green.
- Phase/Step status: Phase 4 advanced ‚Äî CORE-006 filters + retention complete; RBAC audit contract locked.
- Next action (you): Review docs and merge.
- Next action (me): Move to Evidence filters + hash verify and start admin Role Management UI scaffold.

## 2025-09-12 ‚Äî Phase 4 increments (CORE-004, CORE-007, CORE-008, CORE-003)

### Summary
- Evidence: added list filters and optional SHA-256 verification on download; tightened RBAC on routes.
- RBAC UI: delivered role catalog page and user‚Äìrole assignment page (read, attach, detach, replace).
- Exports: enabled background queue path with artifact persistence; added service and feature test.
- Settings SPA: wired validation echo and stub-save flow.
- Docs: updated PHASE-4-SPEC.md and PHASE-4-TASK-BREAKDOWN.md to reflect shipped contracts.
- CI: green.

### API changes
- Evidence
  - `/api/app/Http/Controllers/Evidence/EvidenceController.php`: list filters (`owner_id`, `filename`, `mime` incl. `type/*`, `sha256`, `sha256_prefix`, `version_{from,to}`, `created_{from,to}`, `order`, `limit`, cursor) and `GET|HEAD /evidence/{id}?sha256=` verification returning `412 EVIDENCE_HASH_MISMATCH`. Added `X-Checksum-SHA256`.
  - `/api/routes/api.php`: moved evidence endpoints under RBAC stack with roles `['Admin','Auditor']` for read, `['Admin']` for create.
- Exports
  - `/api/app/Services/Export/ExportService.php`: new orchestrator; enqueues `GenerateExport`.
  - `/api/app/Jobs/GenerateExport.php`: queue-backed generator; writes CSV/JSON/PDF, sets artifact metadata and status.
  - `/api/app/Http/Controllers/Export/ExportController.php`: uses persistence path when enabled; streams artifact on completion; returns `EXPORT_NOT_READY/FAILED/ARTIFACT_MISSING` as applicable.
  - `/api/app/Http/Controllers/Export/StatusController.php`: reports `pending|running|completed|failed` and progress.
  - `/api/app/Models/Export.php`: pending/run/complete/fail helpers; ULID ids; artifact fields.
  - Migration present: `exports` table schema with lifecycle + artifact columns.
- Settings
  - No controller changes in this session; SPA side now surfaces validation.

### Web UI
- Router/Layout/Nav:
  - `/web/src/router.tsx`, `/web/src/components/Nav.tsx`, `/web/src/routes/admin/index.tsx`: added links and route for user‚Äìrole assignment.
- RBAC pages:
  - `/web/src/routes/admin/Roles.tsx`: role list + create (stub-aware).
  - `/web/src/routes/admin/UserRoles.tsx`: load user, attach/detach, replace roles.
  - `/web/src/lib/api/rbac.ts`: client for roles and user-role endpoints.
- Settings page:
  - `/web/src/routes/admin/Settings.tsx`: loads config, displays errors, submits stub save; restricts avatar format to WEBP per spec.

### Tests
- Added `/api/tests/Feature/ExportsQueueTest.php`:
  - Verifies enqueue ‚Üí sync-run path, status reflection, download readiness, and stub path when persistence disabled.

### Docs
- `/docs/PHASE-4-SPEC.md`: 
  - Documented evidence list filters, `?sha256` verification, `EVIDENCE_HASH_MISMATCH`.
  - Clarified export headers and queue notes; included `id` alias in status.
  - Added `/admin/user-roles` to Web UI notes.
- `/docs/PHASE-4-TASK-BREAKDOWN.md`:
  - Marked evidence filters + hash verify complete.
  - Marked exports background queue complete.
  - Marked RBAC UI (roles + user-roles) complete.
  - Updated immediate next steps.

### Configuration notes
- Persistence path for exports requires `core.exports.enabled=true` and `exports` table.
- Tests pin `queue.default=sync`; production queue is configurable.
- RBAC enforcement controlled by `core.rbac.enabled`; `require_auth` gates Sanctum.

### Next steps
1. Add CSV export for audit events and route.
2. Implement avatar transcode worker and resized variants.
3. Minor UI polish per STYLEGUIDE.
