## Instruction Preamble
- Date 2025-09-06
- Phase 4
- Goal Decompose Phase 4 deliverables into detailed, sequential tasks to guide incremental scaffolding, enforcement, and persistence work.
- Constraints
  - No scope outside CharterBacklog.
  - Each increment must pass CIguardrails.
  - Stubs advance to enforcementpersistence gradually.
  - Full traceability to Backlog IDs (CORE-003, CORE-004, CORE-006, CORE-007, CORE-008, CORE-010).

## Cross-Cutting Tasks
- [ ] Update PHASE-4-SPEC.md with final payloads and errors
- [ ] Update CAPABILITIES.md to mark Phase-4 features ‚è≥
- [x] Add unit/feature tests for evidence controllers
- [x] CI guardrails: Pint / PHPStan / Psalm / PHPUnit on PRs
- [x] Composer bootstrap: `scripts/composer/app-prepare.php`, `app:prepare` hook
- [x] Keepers: `bootstrap/cache`, `storage/**` `.gitignore` committed
- [x] Config templates: `api/.env.example`, `scripts/templates/shared-config.php`
- [x] CI DB service: MySQL container + provisioning
- [x] Docs: `/docs/DEV-SETUP.md`, `/docs/MAKE-TARGETS.md`

## Sequencing (Completed)
1. Settings UI scaffolds  
2. RBAC middleware + roles display  
3. Audit Trail stub events  
4. Evidence upload stub  
5. Exports stub lifecycle  
6. Avatars stub  
7. Evidence persistence + retrieval endpoints  
8. CI/dev bootstrap hardening (composer prepare, keepers, MySQL-in-CI, Psalm key)  
9. Audit persistence + retention hooks  

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Phase 4 Completion
- [x] Settings UI echoes configs, validates updates
- [x] RBAC middleware present, roles scaffolded
- [x] Audit Trail stub returns events
- [x] Evidence persisted with sha256 + versioning; retrieval streams with correct headers
- [x] Exports follow job/status pattern (stub)
- [x] Avatars validated (stub)
- [x] Docs/specs/tests updated for evidence
- [x] CI green
- [x] Audit persistence + retention implemented
